## Machine Learning

This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning concepts, most of which I studied throughout my coursework at CMU, and projects I have worked on to further develop my skills.

### Installing necessary Python packages

Each directory in this repository will contain either a particular implementation or a project I have worked on, both of which will require packages like csv, sys, lumpy, time, and copy. While I encourage you to download and run the files herein, understand that you might need to install some packages to ensure a seamless testing experience.
